        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Major Mohit Sharma, SM was leading Bravo Assault Team in operations in Kupwara District of North Kashmir. A
            valiant warrior, he excelled in the art of fighting guerrillas in jungle terrain having earlier spent four
            years in Jammu & Kashmir. On 21 March 2009, after receiving information of presence of some infiltrating
            terrorists in dense Haphruda Forest, he planned meticulously and led his commandos in tracking them. On
            observing suspicious movement, he alerted his scouts but terrorists fired from three directions
            indiscriminately. In the heavy exchange of fire, four commandos were wounded immediately. With complete
            disregard to his safety, he crawled and recovered two soldiers to safety. Unmindful of the overwhelming
            fire, he threw grenades and killed two terrorists but was shot in the chest. In the brief respite that
            followed, he kept directing his commandos, in spite of serious injuries. Sensing further danger to his
            comrades, he charged in a daring close quarter combat killing two more terrorists and attained martyrdom
            fighting for his motherland in the finest traditions of Indian Army.</p>
